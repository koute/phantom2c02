<p>
This chip simulator makes heavy use of the latest version of HTML5 drawing technology.
<p>
It will only run on recent browsers and on a computer with sufficient memory (we recommend at least 2Gbytes.)
<p>
It's been tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera. Unfortunately Internet Explorer isn't yet capable of running the graphics.
<p>
If you're using one of the above browsers and having trouble, please restart the browser.
<p>
In the meantime, here's a picture of what you're missing:
